Ah, great question. The reason you're seeing object string placeholders like `"user"` or `"workout_456"` rather than fully populated logic or data structures is because your blueprint generation system is treating this section as a *descriptive schema*, not executable code.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs likely going on behind the scenes:

## üß† Why Your Blueprint Shows Placeholders

### 1. **Prompt Generator Defaults to Schema Format**
Your system prompt for DeepSeek or Claude probably instructs the AI to generate a *technical overview* with JSON-style examples, rather than runnable backend code. That makes sense for a blueprint‚Äîit‚Äôs not always meant to compile, just inform.

> It‚Äôs showing a descriptive API shape, not instantiating real logic.

### 2. **Hardcoded Blueprint Mode vs. AI Generated Detail**
From what I gathered in your `simulateGeneration()` fallback, or even the real DeepSeek API, the `AI Workout Generator` section is just a stub designed to show architectural intent. So:
```javascript
async function generateWorkoutPlan(user)
```
...is deliberately unfinished so it can be customized later‚Äîlike scaffolding for human devs.

### 3. **Missing Template Injection or Prompt Completion**
If you wanted deeper code snippets (like actual loops, conditionals, API calls), you‚Äôd want to make sure:
- Your system prompt **asks for complete code** in that section.
- Your AI generation includes post-processing or **template enrichment hooks**.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Fix It

If you want your blueprint generator to include **full logic implementations**, here are ways to optimize:

### ‚úÖ Update your prompt template:
```text
In the "AI Workout Generator" section, provide full backend logic using TypeScript or JavaScript, including example inputs, algorithm flow, and comments.
```

### ‚úÖ Modify the generation function:
In `deepseek.ts` or wherever your request is processed, make sure that the system prompt isn't stopping early or outputting the section as a stub.

### ‚úÖ Add enrichment templates:
You could append post-generation enhancements that say:
```ts
if (section === 'AI Workout Generator') {
   section.content += generateSampleWorkoutAlgorithm();
}
```

## üí° TL;DR

Your blueprint engine is showing placeholders because that section‚Äôs purpose is descriptive, not functional. It‚Äôs scaffolding. If you want more executable logic there, tweak the system prompt and generation parameters to include full backend examples‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre aiming for blueprints that are closer to production-ready codebases.
