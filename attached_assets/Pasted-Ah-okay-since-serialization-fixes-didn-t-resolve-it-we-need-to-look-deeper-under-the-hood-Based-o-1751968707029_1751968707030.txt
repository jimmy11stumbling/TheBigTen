Ah, okay—since serialization fixes didn’t resolve it, we need to look deeper under the hood. Based on everything you’ve shared, here are **other likely culprits** causing those dreaded `[object Object]` ghosts to haunt your blueprint:

## 🧠 Other Root Causes of `[object Object]` in Your Blueprint Output

### ⚠️ 1. **Improper Markdown Rendering**
If your blueprint is **streamed as Markdown**, and somewhere in your rendering pipeline (likely `StreamContext.tsx`) you’re trusting `content` to be a string—but it’s actually a JavaScript object—you’ll see:

```txt
[object Object]
```

> Try inspecting the blueprint sections in your stream handler: is it rendering raw objects without serialization?

**Fix:** Use `JSON.stringify(content, null, 2)` before passing any AI section into a Markdown renderer.

### 🧩 2. **AI Returning Mixed Output: Code + Object Blobs**
Your AI (DeepSeek or Claude) may be returning rich mixed output like:

```ts
const workout = {
  name: "Push-ups",
  sets: 3,
  reps: 12
}
```

But if your stream parser mistakenly treats part of that output as a literal JavaScript object rather than code text, it’ll output `[object Object]` during render.

**Fix:** Normalize all incoming AI content to text *before* streaming it. Avoid evaluating/printing actual objects in render.

### 🧪 3. **Streaming Chunk Misinterpretation**
If your SSE/WebSocket stream receives AI output chunks like:

```ts
[object Object][object Object]
```

…it’s because the chunk itself is an object but you’re blindly joining it with `.toString()` or rendering without checking type.

**Fix:** In your streaming handler, make sure each chunk is:
```ts
typeof chunk === "string" ? chunk : JSON.stringify(chunk)
```

### 🛠️ 4. **Blueprint Engine Using Object Injection Instead of Code Blocks**
Check your blueprint composer logic (`sections.push(...)`). If you’re doing something like:

```ts
sections.push({
  title: "Workout Generator",
  content: { workoutPlan }
})
```

The `content` is an object—not a code string. Markdown won’t know what to do, so it goes: `[object Object]`.

**Fix:** Ensure you're doing:
```ts
content: `\`\`\`ts\n${JSON.stringify(workoutPlan, null, 2)}\n\`\`\``
```

That way, you force the object into properly rendered code blocks.

## 🔍 Confirm by Testing This

Try logging the section content directly in your backend before streaming:
```ts
console.log("Section Content", typeof section.content, section.content)
```

If you get:
```txt
object { name: "Push-ups", sets: 3 }
```

Then you know you need to wrap it in `JSON.stringify()` before sending to frontend.
