## **2. The Technical Blueprint (The "How")**

### **2.1. Layer 1: Core Build Prompts & Tasks**
*These are actionable, AI-ready prompts to kickstart development.*

- **UI Component:** "Build a React TypeScript component library with Tailwind CSS that includes a responsive dashboard layout, data tables with sorting/filtering, and form components with validation for i want a fitness app management."

- **API Endpoint:** "Create a RESTful Express.js API with TypeScript that handles CRUD operations for i want a fitness app, includes authentication middleware, input validation with Zod, and proper error handling."

- **Database Schema:** "Design a PostgreSQL schema using Drizzle ORM with tables for users, i_want_a_fitness_app, categories, and audit logs, including proper relationships and indexes."

### **2.2. Layer 2: Master Architecture**
- **Technology Stack:**
    - **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Query
    - **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
    - **Database:** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
    - **Authentication:** JWT with bcrypt
    - **Primary Hosting Platform:** Cursor

- **System Architecture Diagram:**

- **Folder & Component Structure:**
```
/client
  /src
    /components
      - Header.tsx
      - Sidebar.tsx
      - IWantAFitnessAppList.tsx
      - IWantAFitnessAppForm.tsx
    /pages
      - Dashboard.tsx
      - IWantAFitnessAppPage.tsx
    /hooks
      - useIWantAFitnessApp.ts
    /types
      - iwantafitnessapp.ts
/server
  /routes
    - iwantafitnessapp.ts
    - auth.ts
  /models
    - IWantAFitnessApp.ts
  /middleware
    - auth.ts
/shared
  - schema.ts
  - types.ts
```

- **Data Models & Schema:**
```typescript
interface IWantAFitnessApp {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'completed';
  userId: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'user';
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

- **API Endpoints (Contract):**
    - `POST /api/iwantafitnessapp` - Creates a new i want a fitness app
    - `GET /api/iwantafitnessapp` - Retrieves all i want a fitness app
    - `PUT /api/iwantafitnessapp/:id` - Updates a specific i want a fitness app
    - `DELETE /api/iwantafitnessapp/:id` - Deletes a i want a fitness app

### **2.3. Layer 3: Refactor & Optimization Engine**
- **Component Splitting:** Separate data fetching logic into custom hooks, split large components into smaller, reusable pieces, and implement proper component composition patterns.

- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Implement virtual scrolling for large lists, add pagination for data tables, and use React.memo for expensive component renders.

### **2.4. Layer 4: Error Recovery & Resilience**
- **Error Patterns:** Handle network failures with exponential backoff retry logic, implement proper form validation with user-friendly error messages.

- **Debugging Strategies:** Use React Developer Tools for component debugging, implement comprehensive logging with structured error tracking.

### **2.5. Layer 5: Platform & Deployment Strategy**
- **Target Platform(s):** Cursor for development and initial deployment
- **Deployment Workflow:** Git push → automatic build → deploy to production with health checks
- **Environment Variables:** `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `NODE_ENV`, `PORT`
