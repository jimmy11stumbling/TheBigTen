## PART 2: THE SOLUTION - How

### 6. High-Level Architecture
The website will follow a three-tier architecture:
1. **Presentation Layer:** Frontend built with responsive design
2. **Application Layer:** CMS for content + custom ordering/reservation modules
3. **Data Layer:** Database for orders, reservations, and customer data

External integrations will include:
- Payment processor (Stripe/Square)
- Email service (Mailchimp)
- Google Maps for location
- POS system API for order sync

### 7. System Components & Technology Stack
**Frontend:**
- Mobile-first responsive design using Bootstrap
- Progressive Web App capabilities for offline menu access
- Lazy-loaded image gallery for performance

**Backend:**
- WordPress CMS with custom plugins for ordering/reservations
- WooCommerce for order management (modified for restaurant needs)
- Custom API endpoints for POS integration

**Hosting:**
- Managed WordPress hosting with staging environment
- CDN for static assets
- Automated daily backups

### 8. Database & Data Model
Core data entities:
- **Menu Items:** Categories, ingredients, pricing, dietary tags
- **Orders:** Customer info, items, modifications, status
- **Reservations:** Party size, time, contact info, special requests
- **Customers:** Contact info, order history (opt-in)

Relationships:
- One menu item can appear in multiple categories (e.g., tacos under both "Dinner" and "Gluten-Free")
- One customer can have multiple orders/reservations
- Orders contain multiple menu items with customization options

### 9. API & Communication Flow
Key integration points:
1. **Order Submission Flow:**
   - Frontend → Custom Order API → WooCommerce → POS System
   - Confirmation email via Mailchimp/SendGrid

2. **Reservation Management:**
   - Frontend form → Custom Booking Plugin → Google Calendar sync
   - SMS confirmation via Twilio

3. **Menu Updates:**
   - POS system → Menu API → WordPress database
   - Cache invalidation on CDN

### 10. Frontend Approach
**Core Pages:**
1. **Homepage:** Hero image, call-to-action buttons (Order Now, Book Table), daily specials
2. **Menu:** Filterable by category (Starters, Mains, etc.), dietary tags, searchable
3. **Order Flow:** Step-by-step builder for complex items (e.g., burrito customization)
4. **Reservations:** Real-time availability calendar with party size options

**UI Patterns:**
- Consistent color scheme matching restaurant branding
- Food imagery with hover effects showing ingredients
- Persistent cart sidebar for ordering flow
- Form validation with clear error messages

### 11. Security & Non-Functional Requirements
**Security:**
- PCI-DSS compliance for payment processing
- Regular security scans for WordPress vulnerabilities
- Two-factor authentication for admin users

**Performance:**
- <2s load time on 3G connections
- Critical CSS inlined for above-the-fold content
- Image optimization (WebP format with JPEG fallback)

**Accessibility:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigable ordering flow
- ARIA labels for screen readers

### 12. Deployment & Phasing
