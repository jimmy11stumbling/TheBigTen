Locio, I hear you loud and clear—and you’re absolutely right to call this out.

If what you’re seeing in your generated blueprint is a flood of `[object Object]` or empty placeholder strings like `"user"` or `"workout_456"` **instead of actual logic**, that’s a clear sign of a serialization or rendering mismatch between your streaming logic and how the AI output is being parsed or displayed.

Let’s break down *why this is happening* step-by-step:

---

## 🧠 Why You're Getting `[object Object]` Instead of Structured Logic

### 1. **AI Is Returning Real Objects, But They’re Not Being Rendered Properly**
In your server/service pipeline—especially near `deepseek.ts` and `streamOutput()`—it looks like Claude or DeepSeek are generating rich structured data (like JSON or TypeScript objects), but your frontend or streaming engine is treating them like strings in a `toString()` context. Result? You get:
```txt
[object Object]
```
...instead of something like:
```ts
{
  name: "Push-ups",
  sets: 3,
  reps: 12
}
```

### 2. **Streaming Parser Isn’t Handling Multi-line Structured Blocks**
Your SSE or WebSocket stream might be chunking Claude’s output and using `.join()` or `.append()` naively, without preserving formatting like indentation or newlines. That means even correct code gets mushed into `[object Object]`.

### 3. **Templating Layer Might Be Injecting Object IDs Instead of Full Content**
Inside your section array (as seen in `simulateGeneration()`), the blueprint logic is probably doing:
```ts
sections.push({ title: "Workout Generator", content: workoutPlan })
```
…but if `workoutPlan` is a JS object instead of a stringified code block, it’ll log `[object Object]` unless you explicitly do:
```ts
content: JSON.stringify(workoutPlan, null, 2)
```

## 🛠️ How to Fix It

Here’s how you clean this up and make sure your blueprints show real code:

### ✅ 1. Sanitize AI Output on the Backend
In `deepseek.ts`, near wherever you stream Claude’s response:
```ts
// Ensure this
const safeContent = typeof section.content === 'object'
  ? JSON.stringify(section.content, null, 2)
  : section.content
```

### ✅ 2. Fix Streaming Render Logic
In `client/src/components/StreamContext.tsx`, check:
```ts
textContent += chunk.toString(); // risky if chunk is a JS object
```
If it’s a structured block, wrap it safely and display as formatted Markdown or preformatted code.

### ✅ 3. Debug at Claude Level
Use `log(section.content)` before sending it down the stream to verify if the object is real and just being serialized poorly.

## 🧪 Bonus Fix: Inject Prompt Rule
In your Claude prompt:
> “Output all logic blocks as formatted code inside Markdown code fences. Do not return any plain JavaScript objects without converting them to JSON first.”

## 👀 TL;DR

You’re seeing `[object Object]` because the AI probably *is* generating structured logic or JSON—but your blueprint generator is failing to serialize or render it correctly. It’s a frontend or middleware issue, not Claude’s fault. I can help you patch it if you want to clean it up for all future blueprints 🔧
