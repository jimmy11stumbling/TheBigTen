## **2. Detailed System Architecture**  

### **2.1 Frontend Structure (React/Next.js + Wix Editor)**  
The frontend will be built using Base44â€™s React/Next.js framework with Wix Editor for drag-and-drop customization.  

#### **Key Components:**  
- **Dashboard:** Central hub displaying workout history, nutrition stats, and AI recommendations.  
- **Workout Logging Interface:** Form-based input for exercises, sets, reps, and weights with auto-save.  
- **Nutrition Tracker:** Food database integration with barcode scanning (via external API).  
- **Community Feed:** Real-time updates, comments, and likes using Base44â€™s collaborative discuss feature.  
- **Settings & Profile Management:** Role-based access for users, trainers, and admins.  

#### **User Flow:**  
1. **Sign-Up/Login:** Users authenticate via Google OAuth or email/password.  
2. **Onboarding:** AI-driven questionnaire customizes initial recommendations.  
3. **Core Usage:** Users log workouts, track meals, and engage with the community.  
4. **Progression:** AI adjusts recommendations based on historical data.  

### **2.2 Backend & Database (Built-in Node.js + PostgreSQL)**  
Base44â€™s automatic backend handles:  
- **User Authentication:** SSO, role permissions, and secure session management.  
- **Data Storage:** Workout logs, nutrition entries, and user profiles in built-in PostgreSQL.  
- **Business Logic:** Workout algorithms, calorie calculations, and AI model integrations.  

#### **Database Schema:**  
- **Users Table:** `user_id`, `name`, `email`, `role`, `fitness_goals`, `preferences`.  
- **Workouts Table:** `workout_id`, `user_id`, `date`, `exercises` (JSON array of sets/reps/weights).  
- **Nutrition Table:** `entry_id`, `user_id`, `date`, `calories`, `macros`, `food_items`.  
- **Community Posts:** `post_id`, `user_id`, `content`, `likes`, `comments`.  

### **2.3 AI & Third-Party Integrations**  
- **Gemini 2.5 / Claude 4 Sonnet:** Analyzes user data to suggest workouts and meal plans.  
- **Stripe / Wix Payments:** Handles subscriptions for premium features or trainer services.  
- **Email/SMS Notifications:** Reminders for workouts, meal logging, and community interactions.

## **3. Implementation Strategy**  

### **3.1 Step-by-Step Development Process**  
1. **Setup Base44 Project:**  
   - Create a new app in Base44, configure authentication (Google OAuth + email).  
   - Define user roles (Member, Trainer, Admin) with permission levels.  

2. **Design UI with Wix Editor:**  
   - Drag-and-drop dashboard, workout logger, and nutrition tracker.  
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness via Wixâ€™s built-in tools.  

3. **Configure Database Collections:**  
   - Set up `Users`, `Workouts`, `Nutrition`, and `Community` tables.  
   - Establish relationships (e.g., `user_id` foreign keys).  

4. **Integrate AI & Business Logic:**  
   - Use Base44â€™s AI connector to feed user data to Gemini/Claude.  
   - Implement workout recommendation algorithms.  

5. **Enable Payments & Subscriptions:**  
   - Connect Stripe/Wix Payments for premium memberships.  

6. **Deploy & Test:**  
   - Publish instantly via Base44 hosting.  
   - Conduct A/B testing on workout recommendation effectiveness.  

### **3.2 Deployment & Scaling**  
- **Zero-Config Hosting:** Base44 auto-deploys to a scalable cloud environment.  
- **Enterprise Readiness:** SSO, SAML, and role-based controls ensure security.
