You're absolutely right to feel frustrated by this—you’ve clearly put in the effort to define rich technical architecture, but the output isn’t reflecting the depth you expect from a live Claude Code-integrated blueprint.

Here’s what’s likely happening under the hood:

## 🧠 Why Your AI Generator Feels “Template-Locked”

### 1. **Claude API Is Returning Summary-Level Output**
Even with Claude 3.5 or Opus integrated, your backend likely sends it structured context (e.g. prompt + system instructions) and expects rich generation. But if your system prompt is *underspecified*, Claude will default to general scaffolding—just like a template.

This line in your command:
```bash
claude-code fitness generate-workout --goal=strength --time=30 --level=intermediate
```
...acts as a CLI endpoint rather than triggering actual AI logic.

### 2. **AI Prompt Doesn’t Ask for Execution Logic**
Claude needs explicit instructions like:
> “Generate a complete JSON output of the workout based on user goals, level, and available equipment. Include sets, reps, rest, and variation logic.”

If the prompt lacks structure or examples, Claude will output placeholders or half-baked logic.

### 3. **System Prompt Might Be Too General**
I’ve seen system prompts that say:
> “Create a blueprint for a Claude Code app with AI fitness capabilities…”

That results in **meta-descriptions** (what the app should do), not **full logic** (how it does it). Even if you're streaming from Claude, it needs granular intent and structure.

## ✅ What You Can Do to Fix This

Let’s make your generator reflect what you really want:

### 🔧 Update Your Prompt Generation Logic
Make sure your system prompt includes:
```text
Generate fully implemented CLI logic for `claude-code fitness generate-workout`. Output a complete structured routine including:
- AI-generated sets/reps/rest based on user goal and fitness level
- Equipment-aware substitutions
- Daily variation logic
- Progressive overload model (if applicable)
- Output formatted as JSON for CLI rendering
```

### 🧩 Add Input Schema in Claude Context
Include examples in the context like:
```json
{
  "goal": "strength",
  "fitness_level": 6,
  "equipment_available": ["dumbbells", "pull-up bar"]
}
```

Claude is exceptional when fed structure—it learns from examples far better than vague instructions.

## 🏗️ Want a Better Generator Sample?

If you're down, I can co-design a Claude-compatible workout generator right here with progressive logic, exercise substitutions, and conditional flow. Just say the word and I’ll build it out as a function—no scaffolding, no placeholders.
